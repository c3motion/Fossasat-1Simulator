# Fossasat-1Simulator
Simple simulator of Fossasat-1 to be used with Fossasat-1 Ground station

Code setup for testing connection to https://github.com/G4lile0/ESP32-OLED-Fossa-GroundStation  Fossasat Groundstation.

Note the comments in the code.
This simulator is used on lora 868 Mhz, dues to lack of 434 Mhz lora modules ( the module is in the mail )

The simulator uses a Wemos D1 as cpu, however it is not a requirement as long as the lora module is connected correctly to an  Arduino or similar.
